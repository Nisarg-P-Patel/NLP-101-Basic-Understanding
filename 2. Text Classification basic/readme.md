# Text Classification Basics

This project demonstrates text classification using various machine learning models on a dataset of Shakespeare's plays. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Text tokenization and stopword removal
- Stemming of tokens
- Feature extraction using `CountVectorizer`
- Model training with Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of word clouds and play counts

## Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Shakespeare Plays](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays). It contains lines from Shakespeare's plays and their corresponding play labels.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `wordcloud`
- `matplotlib`
- `nltk`
- `PIL`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn wordcloud matplotlib nltk pillow
