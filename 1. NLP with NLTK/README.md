# NLP Basics with NLTK

This project demonstrates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. The notebook performs various preprocessing tasks on text documents, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and term frequency analysis. The results are visualized using histograms.

## Features

- Tokenization of text documents
- Lowercasing and stopword removal
- Stemming using PorterStemmer
- Word-document matrix creation
- Term frequency calculation and visualization
- Document frequency calculation and visualization

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `nltk`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas matplotlib
